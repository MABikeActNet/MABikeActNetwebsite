## Massachusetts Bike Action Network

MABikeActNet is a grass-roots organization aimed at alerting to and informing Massachusetts cyclists of issues and public processes that threaten the right to free and safe travel by bicycle - in particular, local and state regulatory, legislative, public works, and policy hearings. We aim to be a clearinghouse of anti-bicycle activities or statements by public employees, officials, elected representatives, agencies, lobbyists, law enforcement, or members of the judiciary.

We:

- Collect information by way of messages on social media from people like you (we will be monitoring Twitter and Facebook), or submissions to our tracking database (TBD)
- Make announcements via social media (Twitter and Facebook; Instagram to come) and an announcements email list.


### How to use our services

- Follow us on social media via [our Twitter account](https://twitter.com/MABikeActNet) and [our Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MABikeActNet/).
- Join our [announcements email list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mabikeactnet). If you join, please periodically check your spam/promotions folders and make sure our messages are not being mis-categorized.

### How you can help

_This list is preliminary. Please check back for updates!_

- Get the word out; mention us to other cyclists, and encourage them to follow us / subscribe. Share our posts within relevant communities and to appropriate audiences on social media.
- Help us search/monitor; search social media, regularly check your town/city meeting agendas/announcements, read meeting minutes. Tools like [VisualPing](https://visualping.io/) can help by notifying you when an agency updates a page containing announcements, agendas, or project information. Some agencies offer automated email notification lists; other departments, committees, and agencies will add you to an email distribution list if you inquire. See something bicycle related? Collect as much relevant information as possible, and then let us know.
- Let us know if you have talents and services we could potentially use. We will in particular need HTML coders, graphic artists/designers, programmers, and social media editors.
- Help us maintain resources such as lists of hearing announcement pages, agency point-of-contacts, quick references of talking points / responses to common anti-cycling arguments, and more.
