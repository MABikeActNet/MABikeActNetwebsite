## Massachusetts Bike Action Network

MABikeActNet is a grass-roots organization aimed at informing Massachusetts cyclists of issues and public processes that affect them - in particular, local and state regulatory, legislative, public works, and policy hearings and other activities.

We:

- Collect information by way of messages on social media from people like you (we will be monitoring Twitter and Facebook), or submissions to our tracking database (TBD)
- Make announcements via social media (Twitter and Facebook; Instagram to come) and an announcements email list.


### How to use our services

- Follow us on social media via [our Twitter account](https://twitter.com/MABikeActNet) and [our Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MABikeActNet/).
- Join our [announcements email list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mabikeactnet), where we will send messages such as a summary of recent and upcoming activity. If you join, please periodically check your spam/promotions folders and make sure our messages are not being mis-categorized.

### How you can help

_This list is preliminary. Please check back for updates._

- Mention us to other cyclists, and encourage them to follow us / subscribe. Share our posts within relevant communities and to appropriate audiences on social media.
- Regularly check your town/city meeting agendas and announcements. Tools like [VisualPing](https://visualping.io/) can help by notifying you when an agency updates a page containing announcements, agendas, or project information. Some agencies offer automated email notification lists; other departments, committees, and agencies will add you to an email distribution list if you inquire. See something bicycle related? Collect as much relevant information as possible, and then let us know.
- Volunteer your talents and services. We need for HTML coders, graphic artists/designers, programmers, and social media editors.
- Help maintain lists of resources for others, such as hearing announcement pages, agency point-of-contacts, and more.
